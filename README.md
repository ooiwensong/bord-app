# Bord - A Boardgames Collection App

Bord is an app that lets users build and share their boardgame profiles. Currently, it lets users search for games on the BoardGameGeek database and read up on them in more details. More importantly, it also allows users to add games to a collection. These games will then be displayed on the main page of the app.
